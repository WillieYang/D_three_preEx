GCSS-MC is based upon the Marine Corps Logistics Operational Architecture and logistics business process reengineering initiatives. GCSS-MC is part of a joint GCSS effort, managed by the Joint Staff J-4, aimed at improving logistics capability and filling in deficiencies in the accuracy and timeliness of logistics data. GCSS-MC/LCM:  GCSS-MC Logistics Chain Management (LCM) is a program within GCSS-MC. It is comprised of Increments 1, 2, and 3.  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC.  It provides initial capabilities for GCSS-MC.  The system provides Combat Service Support functionality: Supply, Maintenance, Task Organization, and Request Tracking in a shared data environment in support of deployed operations. Specifically the system centralizes logistics information for access by multiple authorized users (closing a significant warfighting gap), complies with the J-4 GCSS Mission Area Interface Control Document that establishes a DoD Family of Systems for logistics information visibility and decision support, and satisfies initial Marine Corps requirements for meeting Combatant Commander 129/57 Data Elements that provide asset visibility data to Combatant and Joint Task Force Commanders.   GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1:  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC/LCM.  It is a separate acquisition program with its own milestone events.  It is based on the implementation of Oracle e-Business Suite 11i as the core software package.  Increment 1 provides the foundation for all future Marine Corps logistics systems modernization.  Increments 2 and 3 are not reported here because they have not officially been approved through the new Business Case Lifecycle (BCL) process.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "The Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS) will modernize and automate the Information Technology (IT) capabilities for qualifying Applicants into the Military Service during wartime, peacetime, and mobilization.  VIPS will enable a responsive, flexible and efficient means to qualify Applicants to meet manpower resource requirements for the uniformed Services, Coast Guard, and National Guard routine and contingency operations.  VIPS will be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and will replace their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS).  USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment.  VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI).  When fully implemented, VIPS will reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices.  The implementation of a Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) approach will enable accession data to be securely available to applicants and ACOI partners such as Recruiting and Training Commands, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Military Health System, Human Resource Management (HRM), and Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO).  VIPS will support compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) direction for a net-centric environment and take advantage of automated data capture technology, e.g., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results.  The accessioning system of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free, and automated to assist with bringing the right people at the right time to operational commanders.  The VIPS Program has not yet been baselined.",

JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that is more affordable and will function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications. The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide. Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time. JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with U.S. allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities. JPALS will eventually support unmanned and highly automated aircraft, and will be able to operate during restricted Emission Control (EMCON) conditions.The approved JPALS Acquisition Strategy has acquisition broken into seven increments, based on technology maturity and Service needs. Increment 1 Sea Based JPALS is separated into two phases; Increment 1A ship based systems and Increment 1B aircraft integration. Navy is the lead for Increments 1A and 1B only.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "LMP - Increment 1 was fully fielded as of October 2010 and is on target to achieve Full Deployment status on the deployed operational baseline in December 2011.   The objective of the LMP - Increment 2 is to enhance LMP by implementing and fully integrating the documented and approved Expanded Industrial Base (EIB) requirements. The EIB requirements include Shop Floor Automation (SFA), Item Unique Identification (IUID), Enterprise Equipment Master (EEM), Automated Identification Technology (AIT), and Plant Equipment Maintenance (PM). Over the past five years, the EIB requirements have emerged from the DoD, the Army and the AMC industrial base. Under close examination of the total requirements set and in line with the current LMP solution, it became clear that EIB requirements were very interrelated and needed to be designed and tested together in a comprehensive solution based on the SAP capabilities. Examination of the complexity involved in implementing these requirements independently is neither logical nor supportable within current resource constraints. Accordingly, the Army determined the need to address these requirements by expanding the LMP solution. The solution for these requirements will be designed, built, and tested together and implemented in cohesive packages to the LMP user community that will meet the critical needs of the various stakeholders, enabling the Department to achieve a clean audit while providing interoperable tools for total asset visibility across the Defense Enterprise.  Ultimately, LMP - Increment 2 will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the currently deployed solution by providing the critical (e.g. must have) SFA requirements integrated with IUID, EEM, AIT, and PM. The enhancements provided by EIB will provide access to real-time supply chain information at all levels of the enterprise down through the shop floor, and will result in manufacturing (MAN) and remanufacturing (REMAN) capabilities that will improve visibility of work-in-process (WIP), quality management, capacity planning, and traceability/genealogy capability; and implementation of electronic work instructions. Implementation of a consolidated approach of these enhancements at the depots and arsenals will help minimize re-work, causative research, material cost escalation and labor costs increases and comply with the DoD IUID implementation directive.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "The Situation Awareness DataLink (SADL) integrates US Air Force Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft with the digitised battlefield via the US Army Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS). SADL is designed to provide fighter-to-fighter, air-to-ground and ground-to-air high speed data communications that are robust, secure, jam-resistant and contention free. It has automatic and on-demand position and status reporting for situation awareness.The US Army''s Force Battlefield Command for Brigade and Below (FBCB2) employs EPLRS as the data communication system backbone for the Tactical Internet (TI). SADL, a variant of EPLRS for aircraft, takes advantage of the EPLRS networking and communications services to provide the pilot with situation awareness and combat ID for the TI.The SADL radio is integrated with the aircraft avionics and displays, providing the pilot with real-time visual tactical data exchange with his wingmen, supporting a variety of co-operative engagement tactics. Fighter positions, radar targets, fuel/weapons stores and ground target positions are shared. The fighter-to-fighter SADL network operation is autonomous and does not rely on the ground-based TI, but can join it, when present, to acquire the ground friendly TI position data. The pilot controls the point around which he can see the closest five TI ground positions, providing for fratricide avoidance in CAS missions. Network planning and initialisation is claimed to be simple and can be customised from the cockpit.",

CAC2S, in conjunction with MACCS organic sensors and weapons systems, supports the tenets of Expedetionary Maneuver Warfare and fosters joint interoperability. CAC2S Increment I will improve current Aviation Command and Control (AC2) systems in the following Marine aviation agencies: Direct Air Support Center (DASC), Tactical Air Command Center (TACC), and Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC). Future increments encompassing Marine Air Traffic Control Detachment (MATCD), Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion (LAAD BN), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and airborne node capabilities are anticipated but are not yet baselined.CAC2S Increment I will be accomplished through a two-phased approach. Phase 1 will address the requirements to establish the baseline CAC2S capabilities for the MACCS and improve AC2 performance and effectiveness. Phase 2 will address the requirements for remaining Aviation Combat Element (ACE) Battle Management and command and control requirements. Limited Deployment Capability will be achieved by 1QFY12 with the completion of Phase 1 development. Phase 1 Full Deployment will commence in FY12. Phase 2 completion will result in the delivery of the full CAC2S Increment I capabilities and is planned to begin fielding in FY15.",

The MDD also supported the development of acquisition planning documentation with a target to enter the formal acquisition process.    Phase I of the AoA focused on preliminary assessment of nine (9) alternatives; five (5) of the alternatives were considered potentially viable and carried into the AoA Phase II for more detailed analysis.

On March 17, 2011, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the VA agreed to jointly pursue a common EHR acquisition.  The Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) (a follow on to originally proposed Electronic Health Record Way Ahead) is designed to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that is available anytime and anywhere for the lifetime of the patient. Since the original Electronic Health Record Way Ahead (EHR WA) has now become a joint DoD/VA program, iEHR has received an Acquistion Decision Memorandum and is now an official DoD program. Rebaseline is to close out EHR WA and insert new projects, activities, and risk for the iEHR.",

AKO provides enterprise-level services to its customer to include user authentication, e-mail, video messaging, web-based collaboration, file storage, and instant messenger.  AKO''s life cycle management plan projects a 20% technology replacement annually and an annual supplement of the storage capacity.  The technology refresh scheduled for this OPA requirement replaces aging Cisco network equipment to include switches, routers and firewalls in both the primary and secondary data centers and on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET.  Much of the AKO Cisco network equipment has aged to the point where it is no longer supported by the vendor.  Hardware failure will cause AKO services to go offline for days, denying users and organizations access to Army applications as well as access to their files and other information until suitable replacement equipment can be procured. These Cisco devices also include firewall devices to meet information assurance requirements. Without the technology refresh of these firewalls, security deficiencies cannot be remediated and the Army LandWarNet is exposed to risk. The storage supplement requirement adds storage capacity, backup capacity and replication capacity to our existing storage services.  Demand for AKO collaboration services continues to grow annually requiring an increase in  storage capacity (raw storage capacity, backup capacity, and data replication capacity).  Also, must maintain the AKO services Continuation of Operations (COOP) systems.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (CIO) issued a memorandum on October 14, 2010 directing all DoD Componetns to develop a plan to implement Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-2) throughout their information systems infrastucture.  Various information systems (IS) such as the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) rely on digital signatures that are electronically signed and validated using the SHA.  By using a private key that is paired with a public key, both generated using SHA, a file can be electronically signed and the signature verified by a recipient.  SHA is also used to provide assurance that file has not been altered, either intentionally or unintentionally, during transmission.  The current standard for that utility is know as SHA-1.    DoD has mandated that all DoD systems must use a new version fo SHA-2 no later than December 31, 2013.An initial evaluation of the DCPDS system identified several hardware and software items that will be affected by this security posture change.  As spelled out in the memo, software and hardware will need to be upgraded to meet the minimum SHA-256 requirement to keep DCPDS in compliant with all DoD rules, regulations and directives.  Specific hardware and software is required since they directly integrate with existing equipment and software currently in use.",

This will include gathering end-user requirements through formal and informal communication, utilizing unstructured data to gather information on other syndromic surveillance systems and system needs, developing an Operational Plan, and reviewing/revising the existing Strategic Plan to reflect changes in the BioSense Program. It will also require establishing a TEP, which will provide input and advice on the development of the new BioSense Program. It will further require producing standardized system requirements for program design concepts and prototypes, which can be developed using open-source/open-access tools. Program design concepts and prototypes will be reviewed and evaluated internally and by an external group of end users. The final selected program design concept/ prototype will include specification, security requirements, proposed program development, testing and evaluation, and documentation. Management support will include the following:- updating the existing BioSense Strategic Plan;- assessing the risks inherent in this plan (already commenced, but assessment of the risks will be ongoing throughout the project);- producing and actively maintaining a Risk Mitigation Plan for the BioSense Program;- providing project support and administration.",

This redesign will also close the gap in support of the mission delivery and management support by making extensive changes to the existing MSIS. To satisfy the new requirements, the MSIS will collect and report on 300-500 additional data elements on a projected monthly collection/reporting process. This will require technical assistance for the states to 1) identify state source systems for new data elements, 2) collaborate with the State CHIP Agency for reporting data to MSIS, 3) ensure that Managed Care plans are sending necessary claims data to states, and 4) ensure and map managed care claims into MSIS. Automation tools will be introduced to extract, transform and load (ETL) data and for the Data Quality/Accuracy process and to enhance analytics for MSIS Front-End data collection.  The redesign also includes plans to link the MSIS to other Medicaid programs, and to develop interoperability between MSIS (redesigned) and other State Health Exchanges.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "This project is the first phase of a multi-year effort across multiple releases to incorporate the Level 1 Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) Appeal entities as users of the Medicare Appeals System (MAS). The original goal of MAS was to utilize MAS throughout the five levels of the Medicare appeals process. This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process. The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed.  Given the MAS' capabilities for cross-level case tracking, interfacing with the shared systems, and electronic imaging, we believe that expanding use of the MAS to encompass first level appeals has the potential to create significant efficiencies in the claim appeals process. Thus, CMS is exploring options to implement the MAS at all Durable Medical Equipment MACs (DME MACs) and Part A and Part B MACs (A/B MACs).",

These data are not collected or stored in standardized format and, for this reason, cannot be evaluated across multiple studies, products or populations except with great difficulty. The goal of this project is to develop and use the standards, infrastructure (including repository and scientific capacity), tools and policies needed for FDA to receive, process and analyze study data, including analyses for comparative effectiveness research.  The infrastructure and approaches developed will enable more efficient and effective review of regulated products data and the conduct of complex regulatory research, including PCOR using the agency's vast, but untapped, stores of patient safety and clinical efficacy data.  New scientific approaches and expertise, data standards, infrastructure, tools and capabilities will be essential to manage the increasingly complex and voluminous information submitted to the FDA in support of regulatory actions, as well as in Patient-Centered Outcome Research, PCOR (formerly known as Comparative Effectiveness Research, CER) analyses (i.e. across products, studies and populations) in non-FDA data.  Thus, as part of this project, FDA is developing the appropriate infrastructure, tools and capabilities, as well as creating a Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science for Medical Products (PACES) to support development and evaluation of comparative effectiveness approaches, and best practices and guidelines for conducting cross study comparisons. The work intends to inform medical practice with respect to benefits and best use strategies for existing therapies in particular patient populations to address which treatment works best, for whom, and under what circumstances. Additionally, development of innovative study design methods will enable more comprehensive comparisons of new therapies with those already in use, allowing both existing and novel therapies to be targeted to maximize benefit and minimize risk.  Collaborations with academic or other non-governmental groups, including developmental research, support of public workshops and training programs will be developed and integrated to achieve these goals.",

FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) is a Web-based Oracle database application and Business Intelligence data warehouse that will replace legacy AERS (Adverse Event Reporting System).  FAERS will contain post-market adverse event reports associated with drugs and biologic products.  These adverse event reports are submitted to FDA by manufacturers, healthcare professionals, and consumers.  FDA will use FAERS for regulatory compliance, and to monitor for adverse events and medication errors that might occur with approved products.  FAERS is an Oracle operational database. Operational databases can store large amounts of data, and allow users to quickly enter, revise, and retrieve information from one system.  When FAERS replaces AERS, FAERS will contain more than six million adverse event reports, and the dataset will continually change as new reports or follow up information is entered into the database.",

The Division of Compliance Risk Management and Surveillance evaluates and prioritizes drug quality reports in order to identify and follow-up on significant health hazards through assignment and review of investigative reports.  Drug quality reports are also used to identify industry trends associated with pharmaceutical manufacturing, packaging, and labeling.   These product quality reports are also part of the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program and FAERS users should have the ability to analyze these reports in conjunction with adverse event reports.

      "ProjectDescription" : "This project provides program level activities to support work across all of MARCS, in particular for non functional testing and implementation. MARCS is divided into a set of components. There are application and service components. The work flows in ORA will often cross multiple organizations and include a number of different user activity types such as screening, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, and compliance. The application components are designed to provide user groups with a one stop shop interface that will allow them to perform work from their user point of view. Functionality is only implemented once in a component. One user group work flow may use functionality from most of the MARCS components. This has implications for the management of MARCS. While the individual projects build out certain types of functionality, these need to be combined and coordinated into a whole in order to provide a useful work flow that covers the whole life cycle of a regulated product as it passes from one user group to the next. This combination and coordination needs to occur at the program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. PMTI includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI begins work on a release when it is time to start system integration testing. Work for a release includes system integration testing, promotion to the pre-production environment, performance testing, user acceptance testing, promotion to the production environment, security testing, and then release. Program management in this project includes release management and management of dependencies. This also includes system architecture, a road map, inter project coordination, decision analysis (for technology and platform selection), security work, user experience management (user friendly and consistent interface), inter project requirements management, status meetings, reports, risk management, and configuration management. This project is the point at which the prime contractor is responsible for MARCS.",

This is the case for recall audit check, which was partly built in FWM but will now be finished in FWM 2. Functionality in this component is being built for two separate user platforms. It will be available on the standard FDA laptops. It will also be available on Remote Access Devices (RADs). RADs are handheld devices. This includes an investigation into potential RAD platforms and a recommendation for this. This is the first time a RAD will be directly integrated with the FDA network, so a number of issues need to be resolved. In addition, functionality on laptops and RADs will be available in two modes: online and offline. An offline mode is needed as Field work is often done in remote locations with little or no connectivity. The technology that is being used to implement this is Sybase SQL Anywhere and Afaria.

      "ProjectDescription" : "This project will provide program level activities to support work across all of MARCS. The combination and coordination of work needs to occur at the MARCS program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI 2. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. This includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI 2 will begin work on a release when it is time to being system integration testing. Work for a release includes system integration testing, promotion to the pre-production environment, performance testing, user acceptance testing, promotion to the production environment, security testing, and then release. Project and program management in this project includes release management and management of individual projects. This also includes system architecture, a road map, inter project coordination, decision analysis (for technology and platform selection), security work, user experience management (MARCS user friendly and consistent interface), inter project requirements management, status meetings, reports, risk management, and configuration management. This project is the point at which the prime contractor is responsible for MARCS. MARCS 0.5 includes Data Sharing Services (DSS) and Center Views (CV). MARCS 1.0 includes functionality for Recall Audit Checks by FDA and State personnel. MARCS 1.1 includes enhancements to Predictive Risk-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) to support import screening. MARCS 2.0 includes ARRMS, Import Trade Auxiliary Communications System (ITACS), and enhancements to some of the MARCS services. MARCS 2.1 includes DGS, Product Services (PS), Date Lookup and Code Management Services (DLCMS), User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), and Firm Management Services (FMS). MARCS 2.2 includes functionality for inspections and investigations.",

FMS will provide functionality to add, edit, merge, unmerge, and delete Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). Each physical location of a regulated organization is a separate FEI. In addition, different types of products that are in one physical location will often require different FEIs. It is not uncommon for a large conglomerate to have multiple FEIs. Managing this information is a perpetual challenge as this information is always changing as firms continually change. In addition, information received, especially from foreign firms, is often not correct or complete and needs to be massaged to identify FEIs. FMS interfaces directly with the Regulatory Business Information Services (RBIS) Firm Master List Services (FMLS) to support FEI data quality.

This is work where an FDA person does actual work dealing directly with a regulated product. FWM 3 includes work on inspections, investigations, field exams, sample collections, portions of sample analysis, third party certification and auditing (TPCA), and compliance follow up. FWM 3 will focus on completing inspections, building investigations, field exams, and sample collections, gathering requirements for sample analysis, TPCA, and compliance follow up. Field operations is one of the six domains that make up the ORA work flows. FWM is the component that will provide the functionality for this domain. This is a large set of functionality that is being built out over a set of projects. Functionality is built out in an incremental fashion where, for example, one project might focus on requirements and design and another project would focus on development and test. This is the case for inspections, which was mostly built in FWM 2 but will now be finished in FWM 3. Functionality in this component is being built for two separate user platforms. It will be available on the standard FDA laptops. It will also be available on Remote Access Devices (RADs). RADs are handheld devices. A pilot will be conducted using Apple and Android products to prove out the expected ROI and determine a final RAD platform. This is the first time a RAD will be directly integrated with the FDA network, so a number of issues need to be resolved. In addition, functionality on laptops and RADs will be available in two modes: online and offline. An offline mode is needed as Field work is often done in remote locations with little or no connectivity. The technology that is being used to implement this is Sybase SQL Anywhere and Afaria. FWM 3 includes work to incorporate this technology and build up the FDA infrastructure to support this.",

For EM, this will focus on migrating functionality from the legacy systems Operational and Administrate System for Import Support (OASIS) and Entry Review to support 801(a) screening. For ITACS, this will focus on account management (via Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS)) and additional functionality enabled by logins. For PREDICT, this will focus on building functionality to better manage rules. For PNM and CSI, this will focus on requirements. EM will provide functionality for screening, in conjunction with PREDICT, for the majority of the 20,000,000+ products imported via the 801(a) process annually. This will give import screeners and import compliance officers a unified interface for dealing with all of their work flows, including tracking Field Work (accomplished in Field Work Manager (FWM)). PREDICT is an expert system built around a rules engine that produces a risk-based score of imported products. Products with a low score are automatically sent forward by PREDICT. Products with a higher score require an import screener to review the product by using EM. ITACS is used to interface with import filers and industry to provide a conduit for supporting documentation. This will reduce the current use of phone calls and emails, provide FDA with a more reliable information source and record, and give industry a more efficient way of communicating. Use of this component by industry is voluntary, so it must provide an incentive for external partners. PNM will provide the interface for work flows associated with 801(m) import screening, Prior Notice, which is focused on Food Security and Food Safety. This will replace functionality currently in OASIS. CSI will replace the outdated technology currently used for the interface between FDA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Work on CSI is dependent upon and must be done in conjunction with CBP so as to accommodate CBP modifications and enhancements.",

Work for DSS, SERS, and NS focuses on final changes to fully conform to the new MARCS architecture. DSS currently provides for materialized views of Center databases in order to give MARCS users 24x7 access to this Center data. This may be expanded in the future for data sharing needs within FDA and with external partners. SERS provides a programmatic and user interface for the storage and retrieval of documents (including photographs, scanned items, and other evidence) to support the regulatory and legal requirements of ORA. NS provides automated communication via email and fax for use within FDA and with external partners. DLCMS, PS, and UWES will be built under SS. DLCMS will provide functionality for non technical government FTEs to manage reference data used to identify products and activities. Currently, this can only be changed by engaging technical personnel to adjust information in tables. PS will combine the best of breed of six separate legacy implementations for managing, searching, and updating regulatory product information. This information originates in the Centers, but is used by ORA in many of its work flows, so ORA needs a service to support the management and aggregation of this product information. UWES will use the COTS Oracle WebCenter product to provide a unified and consistent portal-like user experience across all of MARCS. The user view will be customized according to role.

This includes an expansion of the licenses for the BPMS (Business Process Management Suite) (including Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)), Oracle Identity Management (IDM) Suite, WebCenter, Oracle Policy Automation (OPA), and Real User Experience Insight (RUEI). The license expansion for the BPMS includes enough licenses for all FDA users. A number of FDA Centers have expressed interest in using this platform for their systems. MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences. OPA is a rules engine that will have a number of applications in MARCS ranging from inspection preparation, intelligent questionnaires, and import screening support. RUEI is a tool that can be used from a centralized location to determine the experience that an end user at a remote site is having. ORA is a geographically dispersed organization. In this sense, the user community for MARCS is different from Center user communities since the vast majority of users are not in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This tool will give ORA and OIM a new ability to understand what is actually happening at user sites and will enable a systematic approach towards improving performance and reliability in the Field. The software acquired will be used in all of the MARCS projects going forward to one degree or another and will enable MARCS functionality that will be realized in releases.",

This project is a continuation of ARRMS 2 Supplemental to implement roles and organizations capability using the Oracle Identity Management (IDM) suite of COTS products. Due to the geographically dispersed nature of the ORA organization and that regulated products will often travel from one district to another, ORA has some particular security requirements to deal with this that are not offered in any COTS that has been identified. Custom software will be built to provide this specialized functionality.  In addition, ARRMS 3 will expand upon ARRMS functionality to include synchronization with legacy systems, providing a replacement for the MARCS Identity Management (MIM) component, incorporate additional MARCS components into the security services provided by ARRMS, auditing and reporting capabilities, maintain and purge authorizations, integrate with Regulatory Business Information Services (RBIS) and Automated Laboratory Management (ALM) Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), and upgrade to 11gR2.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "The Online Reporting Analysis and Decision Support System (ORADSS) within RBIS contains a Data Warehouse (DW) at its core.  This provides access to historical data from a number of systems, such as MARCS. The DW further contains a reporting database that retains the schema from the Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database from which information was originated. The DW has information in it that has been transformed into a star schema so that it is a Decision Support System (DSS). In addition, for some user communities, it is much more effective for them to only have to deal with a subset of all of the data in the DW. For such user communities, ORADSS has a number of Data Marts (DM) that certain designated users can use for querying. These are also used to support universes for reporting. ORADSS uses a COTS, Business Objects (BO), as a reporting tool. BO utilizes universes as a meta-data layer that allows for an abstraction of the underlying schema, table names, row names, and data types so that non technical users can access this data more easily. The universe structures may then be used to build reports. End users typically interact with the reports, but there are a number of end users who need to delve more deeply into the data than is allowed by a report. These users may access the DW, DMs, or universes directly depending on their particular needs. This project specifically focuses on providing better data availability for compliance users, MARCS Predictive Risk-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT), and an organizational group in ORA that tracks resources and conducts work force planning.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "FMLS in RBIS is closely aligned with Firm Management Services (FMS) in MARCS. FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information. This includes receiving firm information from registration and listing from the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS). FURLS is being partially replaced by eLIST. FMLS will integrate with eLIST (no acronym). The firm data is built around Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). These define a location and a product or a set of products. A large company may have multiple FEIs if it has multiple physical locations and/or produces different products that are regulated by FDA. This information is always changing as firms and market conditions change.  In addition, foreign firms that do not use a Latin alphabet present a particular problem as words can be transliterated into English in different ways. If this is left unchecked, it causes a proliferation of FEIs that are not all that useful in identifying what firm is what. To address this, FMLS employs Dataflux, a COTS, in implementing survivorship rules that are used to clean up this firm data and consolidate and remove FEIs. FMLS is also being integrated with Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB). DnB has one of the largest and most reliable databases on businesses in the world. This is being leveraged to improve the quality of firm information, especially that related to foreign firms. This project focuses primarily on integrating with eLIST, improving survivorship rules and their application, and integrating with DnB. This provides MARCS FMS with access to higher quality data in regards to firms, which is used throughout the ORA regulatory work flows.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "This project focuses primarily on Firm Master List Services (FMLS). This includes additional Center integration, gray area resolution, additional support for Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB) integration, and improved integration with  Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services (MARCS) Predictive Risk-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) for validating firm information. FDA receives much firm information via Center systems, including FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS) and eLIST (no acronym). This will focusing on improving and automating more of this information transfer. Gray area resolution is used to resolve uncertainties regarding firm information when the survivorship rules used in FMLS do not produce a clear resolution. Survivorship rules are implemented via the COTS Dataflux and are an automated way to correct firm data, merge, unmerge, and delete Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEI). Manual gray area resolution is performed to tweak survivorship rules and manually resolve information discrepancies. DnB integration will be expanded, including a review of the current firm inventory in ORA and matching these against DnB information to produce a confidence level from 1 to 10 (10 is highest confidence) to support estimating the risk associated with a firm based on the quality of firm information. This will be used to support risk based decisions such as used for import screening. The method used to validate firm information from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that is then used by PREDICT in import screening will be modified to improve this, reduce latency, reduce uncertainty, and reduce reprocessing. FMLS in RBIS is closely aligned with Firm Management Services (FMS) in MARCS. FMLS does the back end heavy lifting work for managing firm information. As FMS is modified, FMLS will also be modified to support expanded functionality for MARCS users.",

In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established.   The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors.  Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy. FHA serves the needs of more than 20 Federal Agencies in domains as diverse as military and veterans' healthcare, public health monitoring, long-term care and disability services, research, tribal health services and many other critical Federal priorities.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "The Dashboard and Business Intelligence project addresses the gap identified during the UFMS Deep Dive Assessment to improve reporting and decision support across HHS OpDivs and StaffDivs.  This was a key short-term, high-impact recommendation specified in the UFMS Deep Dive Assessment Final Report; it received the highest priority rating from points of contact for UFMS OpDiv and StaffDiv stakeholders for projects to be pursued.  The scope of this project is to (1) define an HHS-wide reporting strategy, and (2) to implement Oracle's Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) and address this business need for users of UFMS.  This project heavily leverages work performed by FDA on their OBIEE pilot.  This involved implementation of OBIEE Plus for use by approximately 50 seat licenses; configuration of extract, transform, and load (ETL) routines to load FDA data from UFMS and to address Oracle Descriptive FlexFields (DFFs); and enhancement and development of dashboards and reports to meet FDA specific business needs.  These configurations and enhancements can be adjusted to enable rapid development and delivery of a global UFMS data warehouse for use with OBIEE.  Program data can be integrated either through individual data warehouses for each set of books (SOB), or loaded into the single central warehouse.  While our preliminary analysis indicates a hybrid approach that shares a central financial data warehouse with OpDiv-specific program data warehouses as most likely the best fit architecture for OpDiv business needs, the detailed OBIEE needs assessment work that is being planned by the UFMS Program Management Office (PMO) will determine the specific details of the go-forward solution.  This solution seeks not only to improve reporting and decision support, but also to consolidate the large number of disparate reporting systems used across the Department that provide redundant capabilities today.  From an application architecture perspective, the dashboard and reporting solution will integrate with:*         Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) applications that form the COTS foundation of UFMS*         Consolidated Financial Reporting System (CFRS)*         The budget solution that is a part of this modernization program*         Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS)*         Other program data and warehouses with which the financial data will be tied to facilitate improved reporting and decision support.",

The project includes incorporating additional functionality in the system that supports the lifecycle management of budgets - from formulation through execution.  However, as the HHS the Office of is in early planning stages seeking to implement the Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS) as a Department-wide budget formulation tool, this effort will focus on the budget planning through budget execution functions with an interface to DEBS and integration with UFMS.  Improvement in this area directly affects audit material weaknesses related to budgetary analysis,[1] such as reducing manual entries and facilitating compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA).  This also addresses a common sentiment among the user groups that UFMS is an accounting system rather than a financial management system.The Hyperion Performance-Based Budgeting Solution provides an enterprise-level solution for budget formulation, execution, and distribution, which eliminates the need for multiple spreadsheets, separate feeder applications, and numerous individual processes.  This will allow users to spend less time reconciling data and more time analyzing and planning, provides for more accurate reports to OMB, the ability to monitor and measure agency performance against agency goals, provides security and audit trails, and offers a variety of statements and reports.  This solution seeks to replace cuff systems that are currently used by budget staff across HHS agencies to meet the functionality gap that exists today.  From an application architecture perspective, the budget solution will integrate with:*         Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS) *         Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) applications that form the Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) foundation of UFMS*         Consolidated Financial Reporting System (CFRS)The Dashboard and HHS-Wide Reporting solution that is a part of this modernization program.",

CTEP-ESYS collects safety and clinical results data on 1,356 ongoing cancer clinical trials (trials not yet completed); of those 1,116 are treatment trials. CTEP-ESYS tracks more than 27,000 patients per year in more than 24 disease areas. The system supports 517,000 drug orders and 37,000 registered investigators. Data reporting and analysis in real time is critical to ensuring adequate monitoring of the ongoing clinical research. Timely data reporting and analysis also assures effective planning for the required successor studies, thus accelerating the evaluation of promising new agents and regimens for patients with cancer. An effective CTEP-ESYS allows investigators and researchers to focus on scientific opportunity, patient safety and reducing the burden of cancer on the public by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. There are many components that support CTEP needs including protocol tracking, agent authorization and tracking, clinical data reporting, adverse event reporting and processing, clinical trials auditing, financial management, investigational new agent and development, disease management and tracking, annual report generation, regulatory activities, account management, investigator registration, reporting and analysis. CTEP-ESYS consist of a common repository that interfaces with suite of applications that are integrated and support the cancer-clinical trials infrastructure.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "NwHIN Exchange is a critical portion of the National health IT agenda intended to facilitate development of standards based health care information exchange among providers, consumers and other stakeholders involved in supporting health and healthcare. This investment will enable the development of standards in health information exchange that follow the consumer, be available for critical clinical decision making, and support appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care so as to improve health outcomes. The investment seeks to achieve these goals by coordinating stakeholders in developing interoperable standards and by engaging industry and federal agencies in developing prototypes and trials. Executive Order 13410 requires Federal Agencies to adopt health IT standards that have been recognized by the HHS Secretary when developing or enhancing health information systems.     Initially established as a program under ONC in 2004, the goals of the program, then called NHIN Exchange were to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by establishing a mechanism for nationwide health information exchange. The NwHIN Exchange went through a prototyping and trial implementations phase where an architecture and set of Service Oriented Architecture based specifications were developed to provide a common, secure and trusted network to enable the exchange of health information among private networks and Federal health networks. The effort effectively integrated specifications, implementation guidelines, compliance, interoperability verification, and network operations with a strong trust fabric to allow for interoperable health information exchange.      The NwHIN program has evolved to become much more flexible, to include specifications from not only the NHIN Exchange program, but also use specifications developed from the ONC led Direct project. The NwHIN program is envisaged to include a portfolio of specifications from Exchange, Direct and Blue Button. This broad array of standards will allow stakeholders to exchange health related information using internet, at various levels of complexity of needs. The NwHIN has developed and continues to develop modular specifications, reference implementations and detailed test cases, to guide adoption by the stakeholders. These assets are publically available for download on the HHS website.",

The purpose of the TIC program is to optimize individual external connections, including Internet Points of Presence (PoP) currently in use by the federal government.  The TIC Initiative establishes a basis for consolidated infrastructure to achieve interoperability and communication among operating divisions.  In response to this initiative, HHS will adopt a network and security architecture that complies with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) TIC requirements and reduces the total number of external connections to include Internet, inter-agency, partner, contractor, educational, health and research connectivity.   Once implemented, the TIC environment will improve HHS's incident response capability; reduce the number of external connection points within HHS; and provide centralized monitoring of HHS network security controls.  HHS TIC aligns with the HHS 2007-2012 Strategic Plan for IT infrastructure consolidation.  This strategy employs the sharing and reuse of common, standards-based materials and programs that support the business of computer technology.",

The number of quality measures to be included for 2012 is not established at this time.  There were 190 quality measures in 2011.  For 2012 there will continue to be multiple reporting options through claims and will continue to include measure groups.  The Physician Quality Reporting System will support multiple submission methods such as Electronic Health Record Registry and Group Practices Reporting Options (GPROs I and II).  It is anticipated that the incentive will be based, as in past years, on the total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the reporting period.Continuing in 2012, there will be the Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Initiative which is available for those EP's that are considered successful electronic prescribers (eRx-ers) as defined in the CMS eRx specifications.  As in 2011, both individual and selected GPROs may report on the eRx measure through claims, registries or EHR's.  Successful eRx-ers will potentially earn an incentive payment based on their total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the 12 month reporting period.  Currently successful electronic prescribers will not be eligible to receive an incentive under the eRx Incentive Program if they are also receiving an incentive under the Health Information Technology (HIT) Incentive Program authorized by the Recovery Act, enacted on February 17, 2009. Future rule making may further align the incentives programs. EP's that are not electronic prescribers will receive a penalty adjustment starting in 2012 based on the first 6 months of claims data submitted in 2011.  The eRx Initiative will provide Interim Feedback Reporting to EP's.  Measures and other data sources may be added for the 2012 Program Year to allow EP's options for successfully reporting the eRx measure for both the penalty and incentive programs.  EP's may have the flexibility of expanding and adding additional hardship codes for exemption for all years.",

It will identify cognitive support and display change requirements for early transition to a high altitude specialty and will develop and validate automation changes needed to implement a new high altitude operating concept that will create a more flexible high altitude airspace concept by increasing staffing flexibility, reducing training time, and enabling traffic peaks to be handled by fewer controllers. Initial operational concept development and validation efforts have concluded that in high altitude airspace, the local knowledge information needed is considerably less than in lower altitude airspace and that different operating strategies can be used to more dynamically adjust staffing and airspace to meet demand and reduce operating costs. By providing local knowledge through information accessible through the controller display and other tools, there will be increased flexibility in the assignment of airspace to controllers, increasing overall productivity and flexibility to deal with weather and congestion events. This activity will work to define and develop the information display and decision support tool changes to provide this local knowledge and conduct human-in-the-loop simulations with controllers to assess the effectiveness of the information content and automation and display changes to enable rapid training (in terms of hours) of controllers to safely and efficiently control the airspace.",

Conflict resolution advisories will first be implemented using voice and data in a mixed equipage environment, and ultimately will be transmitted solely via data in certain airspace. The implications for changing controller roles and responsibilities will be explored and the requirements for automation, decision support systems and data communications will be identified. High performance aircraft will directly connect via air-ground data communications to the flight management system, facilitating electronic data communications between the Air Traffic Control (ATC) automation and the flight deck automation. As a first step and in mixed performance airspace, the controller will still be responsible for aircraft separation by responding to problems predicted by the ATC automation. Instead of monitoring the sector airspace display to predict potential problems and mentally calculating problem resolutions, the automation will not only predict the problems but determine the best solution. The controller will transmit the solution via voice initially, and then via data link. This level of automation support helps manage controller workload as a means of safely dealing with the predicted increases in traffic volume. This activity will prototype earlier and easier resolutions capabilities (such as pre-probed altitude and speed amendments) that can be transferred verbally by controllers and evaluate the impact these have on the Computer Human Interface (CHI) design and system performance and conduct research into more complex issues for future implementation such as vector advisories as well as the role of the human versus automation in voice clearance, mixed voice and data communications environments, and data communications only.",

This program is taking the results of technology research and development and new wake separation concept modeling and simulation efforts and is evaluating the resulting concept feasibility prototypes for flight safety and impact on the NAS capability for meeting the demand for more flights. Evaluation of the prototype WTMA decision support tool will continue and requirements for implementing the WTMA capability will be developed. The FY12 evaluation of WTMA will lead to an FAA decision in FY13 to transform the capabilities of the prototype software tool into a functioning decision support tool integrated into the terminal automation system for use by the FAA air traffic controllers. First operational benefit will be realized during FY15 when the WTMA controller decision support tool capability is fielded as part of a software release to a FAA terminal automation system.",

A concept engineering analysis of proposed Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) and Tower and Surface traffic management capabilities will be performed to determine which concepts are most beneficial to safely increase capacity, reduce traffic delays, lower costs, and reduce impact on the surrounding environment. The expected outcome of these efforts will result in enhanced capabilities that provide more efficient, safer movement and control of air traffic in the terminal domain. This will also ensure smoother transition into and out of the terminal airspace in support of consolidation of airspace and provide guidance for implementing projects as part of the NextGen Concept of Operations. In previous years, the enabling technologies/information was assessed and methods developed for gathering data, integrating information (i.e., flight data object, clearance (taxi/takeoff) information, surveillance information, user (aircraft/pilot/ airport operators)) and receipt/acceptance of that data. Based on these capabilities, a series of decision support tools were identified. These tools will enhance/optimize airport surface traffic management efficiency, mitigate risk of safety related incidents, and support the overall movement of air traffic in the terminal environment.",

Metered times at key merge points will be used by air traffic managers. For this type of operation, an aircraft's Meter Point Time (MPT) is assigned to determine when it enters into the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) airspace so it can be efficiently routed to the assigned runway. Metering will take into account runway load balancing and will serve to reduce (not eliminate) the need for delay absorption needed for aircraft inside the TRACON airspace. As the FAA transitions to NextGen, aircraft will increasingly be assigned to RNP/RNAV routes and have modern avionics that include Flight Management Systems (FMS) capable of executing Required Time of Arrival (RTA) instructions. The RTA capability provides a time-based control mechanism that supports the trajectory-based operations concept. RTAs will be used for the management of arrival traffic to an airport. The use of RTAs will take advantage of existing capabilities expected to become more widespread throughout the fleet. The FMS in the aircraft computes the most efficient change to the original trajectory to meet the RTA. In addition, the FMS can independently self deliver to the RTA, thus reducing significantly the coordination needed between the user and ATC. Since the FMS actively and directly controls the aircraft to meet the RTA, very accurate arrival is possible with minimal human intervention.",

Weather conditions create low visibility conditions that require Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) to go into effect. Even for those aircraft with suitably trained crew and equipage, conditions may worsen, causing flight diversion, flight cancellation, or flight delays, each of which can result in a cascading ripple effect that can spread throughout the National Airspace System (NAS), even to areas where weather is not an issue. There are periods of low visibility when the aircraft cannot takeoff or land at their desired airport resulting in the following conditions: decreased numbers of arrivals/departures at high density airports; increased flight delays, cancellations, and/or diversions under IFR low visibility conditions; decreased capacity for airlines to schedule flights in marginal weather conditions (since both the primary and alternate routes must be approved within the flight plan); and decreased flexibility/potential congestion in the terminal environment. These problems can limit or prevent access to airports in IFR conditions, resulting in congestion and delay in the NAS. Even under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), access to airports and utilization of airspace can be made more flexible, particularly in the terminal environment. Therefore, lowering required RVR minima will improve capacity during low visibility operations by allowing runways that would otherwise be unusable to continue to support airport operations.",

The FAA business and alternative analysis results to be delivered by NEO Project SP3 is to highlight those FAA standards that will provide situational awareness and common shared information shared services (data displays) through the use of SOA approaches to start showing NextGen Strategy by 2015. NEO SP3 will demonstrate how information sharing and collaboration across multi-agency domains can be accomplished by leveraging existing technology and investments for NextGen transformation. The program will apply lessons learned from NEO SP1 and 2 emerging capability demonstrations that are traceable to the NextGen Baseline Operational Improvement (OI) Roadmap. These transformational concepts are the next building blocks for the NextGen concept.

      "ProjectDescription" : "HSPD-12 falls within the scope of Identity and Access Management. On August 27, 2004, the President issued a Homeland Security Presidential Directive calling for a mandatory, government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the federal government to its employees and federal contractors. The implementation of this Standard will ensure the identification for government employees and contractors is reliable and secure. The establishment of the PIV credential as part of a broader well managed enterprise solution enables common service capabilities in secure and reliable transactions. Further, it expedites SBAs ability to enable IT solutions that directly address line of business needs for disaster response, automated small business services such as electronic (and paperless) workflow services, and reduction in other existing investments for help desk operations and password management. E-Authentication falls within the scope of Identity and Access Management. This initiative expands e-Government by providing users access to online services that require authentication, using a solution that is secure as well as convenient and easy for customers, resulting in an improvement in the taxpayer experience. Through minimizing the burden on America's small businesses, the general public, and government partners, this initiative eliminates the need for separate processes for verification of identity and validation of electronic signatures. The IAM initiative provides a robust, highly secure, easy to manage centralized solution that automates the provisioning and deprovisioning of user identities mapped and managed to individual/entities, and manages each aspect of the identity lifecycle. By automating services, and doing so in accordance with well defined rules and role determination, SBA simplifies the independent management frameworks currently instituted individually by each application. As part of implementing security solutions at the individual application level, SBA addresses security risks on an individual basis, does not take advantage of economies of scale, and institutes varying levels of security, cost, and schedule risk across each program. This initiative will provide a security and operations focus on the management of common security services that are managed with industry proven solutions and solutions that adhere to well defined industry and federal standards.",

A Business Requirements Document describing the business case and desired functionality for this NSR was signed by business owners on December 1, 2010. The Enhancing Veteran Experience and Access to Healthcare (EVEAH) Operating Plan for Fiscal Year (FY) 11-13 reflects this mandate and further supports action on the NSR. IT Patient Safety also evaluated this request and suggested that it be considered mandatory. The pilot program is scheduled for implementation between the second and third quarters of FY11.",

BHIE provides HIE for clinicians and adjudicators to deliver efficient, effective, and timely treatment and claims processing. Clinicians avoid duplicating radiological, lab, and other tests and studies by using BHIE derived clinical data. If BHIE were not funded, then interagency clinical record exchange would degrade and fail.

IRIS runs on a Secure Socket Layer (SSL), enabling an encrypted connection between the Veteran and VA. Medical centers usually assign the IRIS response and tracking process to Patient Advocates at their respective locations.

Crisis Line staff use a web-based application to make referrals from the national hotline to the appropriate field-based Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs). Enhancements to the tool and ongoing maintenance of the application itself are needed.Currently, the application form that Crisis Line staff use does not electronically integrate the use of standard, industry-wide nomenclature that properly classifies self-directed violence. Instead, staff must record the levels of self-directed violence classifications manually into the free text comments field. Unfortunately, nomenclature used in this free-text field cannot be extracted as discrete data elements. As a result, the Suicide Prevention Center of Excellence, which gathers data from the Veterans Crisis Line Application, does not have the ability to properly report on self-directed violence in a manner that is consistent with industry nomenclature and standards. This leads to the inability of the VA to share and compare its information with other suicide prevention centers.",

      "ProjectDescription" : "iTRAK is a major initiative to modernize NSF's financial management capabilities with a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) core financial management solution and interfaces in a shared services environment. iTRAK will replace NSF's existing Financial Accounting System (FAS), which is becoming technically and functionally outdated by growing mission-driven business demands and regulatory requirements. NSF needs to modernize its legacy financial accounting system (FAS), which is over 20 years old and is becoming technically and functionally outdated by growing mission-driven business demands and regulatory requirements. FAS cannot provide the robust financial management functionality needed in today's business environment and required by NSF to provide more accurate and reliable financial information for both external and internal stakeholders. iTRAK will provide NSF internal customers including financial staff, administrative staff, and Program managers, with improved funds management capability, reporting capabilities, and automated business processes. iTRAK will also strengthen internal controls by providing system edit checks and audit trails for all financial transactions. Through new functional capabilities and business process automation and standardization, iTRAK will help to improve NSF's operational excellence and enable efficient, effective execution of financial activities and business operations on behalf of NSF's external customers, science and education grantees. NSF Programs and grantees will also receive better, more timely financial information to manage their portfolios more effectively. An updated analysis of alternatives conducted in 2010 to comply with OMB Memo 10-26. Alt 2, 18-Month Approach, was selected as the superior alternative, resulting in the lowest risk-adjusted lifecycle cost, the highest NPV and ROI, and the highest value score.",
